# First-Project-Idea

My first project

When I was still attending junior high I was interested in learning how to code, the problem was that I had none to teach me and I had no idea what to do.
One day I came uppon a tutorial showing a cool batch script and I was really amazed it looked interesting and a bit Matrix like. So I started writing batch by myself making small useless programs, after a couple of months I saw a video about the Enigma machine and so I started coding one in batch. It took me a lot of time to develop but I was really proud of it!

The program was super slow and badly designed but I would say it marked the begining of my career!

I also included a more modern python implementation
